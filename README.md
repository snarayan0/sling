# SLING - A natural language frame semantics parser

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/sling.svg?branch=caspar)](https://travis-ci.org/google/sling)

SLING CASPAR is a parser for annotating text with frame semantic annotations.
This is the second generation of the SLING parser. The first generation, SEMPAR,
can be found [here](https://github.com/google/sling). CASPAR is intended to
parse using cascades which are handling different parts of the transition
action space.

The CASPAR parser is a general transition-based frame semantic parser
using bi-directional LSTMs for input encoding and a Transition Based Recurrent
Unit (TBRU) for output decoding. It is a jointly trained model using only the
text tokens as input and the transition system has been designed to output frame
graphs directly without any intervening symbolic representation.

The SLING framework includes an efficient and scalable frame store
implementation as well as a neural network JIT compiler for fast parsing at
runtime.

A more detailed description of the SLING parser can be found in this paper:
