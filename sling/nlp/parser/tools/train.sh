# Script for training a Sempar model from scratch.
#
# It should be run from the top-level folder (i.e. the one which contains the
# 'sling' subfolder).
#
# Usage:
#   /path/to/this/script <flags described in train_pytorch.py and train_util.py>
#
# Sample command:
#   /path/to/this/script --commons=commons_file --train=train.rec --dev=dev.rec \
#        --output=out_folder [--word_embeddings=word_embeddings.bin] \
#        [--batch=8] [--report_every=3000] [--steps=100000] [--alpha=0.005]
#
# It takes as input:
# - A file pattern of training documents with gold annotations. Each file should
#   correspond to one serialized Document frame.
# - Path to the commons store.
# - Name of the output folder. All generated resources e.g. feature lexicons,
#   action table, master spec, TF graph, trained model etc. will be dumped here.
# - Word embedding dimension, and optionally a pretrained word embedding.
# - Training parameters, e.g. batch size, training steps, learning rate,
#   checkpoint interval etc.
#
# It outputs a Myelin flow file in the output folder corresponding to the best
# checkpoint.
